# Line Follower Robot

This project was originally created for the TechRadiance 8th and 9th edition competitions. It controls a line follower robot using IR sensors and basic logic implemented in Embedded C via the Arduino IDE.

> ⚠️ The code may need some modifications to work properly depending on your hardware setup.

## Features

- Follows a black line on a white surface using IR sensors
- Basic logic for two-sensor navigation
- Designed for Arduino-based motor control

## Technology Utilized

- **Language:** Embedded C  
- **IDE:** Arduino IDE  
- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno, IR sensors, motors, motor driver (L293d)
